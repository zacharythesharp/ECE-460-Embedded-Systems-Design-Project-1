# ECE 460 Embedded Systems Design Project 1

In the folder 'Project_1_Sharp' is a file called 'ESA Project 1.pdf'. This file contains the entire project description.

The source code for this project was supplied by Dr. Alexander Dean from North Carolina State University. The overall
objective was to expound upon his base code in order to create and new functionalities and expound upon current ones. 

I primarily worked in the following files:
- main.c
- timers.c
- ADC.c
- DebugPorts.c
- ADC.h

This code was run on an NXP MKL25Z MCU. It was developed in the Keil uVision5 IDE using an RTOS2-RTX5 package. In this repository is a folder called 'Project_1_Sharp'. The main folders in this project are as follows:

1. inc: contains all the necessary header files
2. src: contains all the source files
3. All the other files and folders are generated by the Keil IDE.
